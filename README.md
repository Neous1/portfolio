Recommendation is to use bootstrap on this project. The visual aesthetics of the page will be evaluated with the expectation of a bootstrap site. If you would rather not use bootstrap please be sure your own CSS skills can create a clean looking site. You are welcome to use a different CSS tool such as foundation. Simply understand this is expected to be a clean page.
This will be what is referred to as a Single-Page site. This site should include the following:
Minimum of three sections.
A navbar with a navigation element for each section.
Clicking on the nav item should bring me to the section in question.
A footer section is not counted as one of the three sections however should be included
Include clickable items that will take the user to your social media items. Minimum of 2 should be there but feel free to include all your social media items.
Include an external link to your tribute page in some way.
Placeholders for future items are encouraged feel free to use https://placehold.it/ for image place holders.
Additional challenges
Mobile friendly - if using bootstrap be sure the page is set for mobile friendly usage. (hacker level improves on this)
Dropdown menu element - create subsections inside one of your sections update the nav element to include jumps to these subsections.
Hacker level challenges - you will need to research elsewhere to accomplish these.
Make your navbar mobile friendly. The navbar should turn into a menu option on mobile devices.
Include CSS Media queries to change some of the elements for mobile viewing.
Include an audio only or video element to the site. This could be something such as an audio file of yourself talking about a coding concept or a screencast of you coding something for example. Be creative.
Use animate.css to give some animation to your page. This will give you experience using other CSS libraries on your pages.
